# intro-to-python-exercises
completed intro to python exercises for MOOC course

These are unsorted (as in, no exercise# labels) .py files for the MOOC intro to python course offered by Helsinki University.

All exercises were completed except for the last exercise in part08, which was only a partial completion because I haven't put in the time to figure out the loop command for the "Your own Programming Language" exercise.

Parts 01-03 did not require VS Code, and I decided not to include those rudimentary codes.
